      Accelerating Photosensitized Drug Design with Graph Neural Networks
      </h2>
      <div class="project-date">09.2025</div>

      <p>
        During the summer, I worked on a project focused on accelerating sample
        preparation for photosensitized drug design assays using graph neural
        networks (GNNs). The goal was to replace slow, resource-intensive
        prediction pipelines with a scalable, data-driven alternative.
      </p>

      <p>
        Photosensitized reactions play an important role in drug discovery,
        medical imaging, and the study of cell membranes. Gaining a better
        understanding of these processes can directly support the development
        of new therapeutics and diagnostic tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        Traditionally, predicting photosensitization properties requires
        extensive manual analysis by domain experts and can take days per
        compound. The model I developed enables thousands of predictions per
        second while achieving approximately 80% accuracy—performance that
        previously required substantial human effort. This represents a
        significant improvement in speed and scalability for early-stage
        screening.
      </p>

      <p>
        The core idea is to represent molecules as graphs, where atoms correspond
        to nodes and chemical bonds to edges. The neural network learns directly
        from this structure, incorporating a wide range of molecular descriptors
        to approximate real-world chemical behavior. In effect, the approach
        creates a lightweight “digital laboratory” in which molecular
        sensitization can be explored computationally.
      </p>

      <p>
        As part of this work, I also explored <em>UMA</em>, Meta’s large-scale
        molecular simulator trained on over 100 million molecules, which
        provided valuable insights and complementary perspectives on molecular
        representation and simulation.

        This project was carried out in collaboration with NexMR. I am grateful
        to Felix Torres Hubiche and the team for their guidance and for the
        opportunity to contribute to a project with real medical relevance.

        <strong>Ongoing and future work.</strong>  
        My next project will focus on accelerating the computation of quantum
        descriptors. The resulting tools will be released as open-source
        software.
